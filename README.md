## Features

### Future Implementations

I've would like to add nicer UI, or maybe some extra pages.

### Accessibility

The site is accesibly to all screens and in smaller screens the navbar becomes an hamburger menu. The fonts are easy to read and ive included icons to easily see what the textes will provide. The colors are darker and the fonts and text withe, thats makes it easy for the readers to see and read.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

Html, CSS , Javascript and Python+Django. SQL for databases.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.
